## Annotation

This excerpt describes a farmer’s perception of costs and how lockouts do not affect production necessarily. In line with the prior case study that highlight the impact of silo-bags, this illustrate the distinctive features of rural lockouts.


## Interview

[1:04:10] Rapetti: “[when we were discussing a lockout and we were complaining that dairy producers never joined] I was told that I had an alternative that my cattle remain in the countryside eating grass. I said I can put the cattle in the barn. But we always end up paying because if I don’t sell and deliver my cattle to the Liniers estate market during the days of the lockout, when I deliver the cows I do it with everyone else and that depresses the price because we cannot agree that today I send mine and tomorrow you send yours. What we didn’t send during ten days at some point needs to leave, it’s continuous, it’s permanent…” [1:04:47]

[1:11:45] Authors: “If you are in a lockout, do service suppliers continue working in your land or do they join the lockout?”

Rapetti: “No, they don’t. That’s one of the differences that we often mention. **That’s why we usually call it strike outside the gates. Ours is an employer strike. We don’t affect the country like an airline strike does or when a factory strikes**.” [1:12:11]
